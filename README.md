# Dice-Roll-Visualization

Using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) to graph the probability distribution for dice rolls.

## About

**Law of Large Numbers:** In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.<br>

We use a fair dice as an example to demonstrate this law. All the faces of the die are equally likely to occur but initially, when the number of die rolls is small, the frequencies of the faces is uneven and the probability may be more for one face than others.
When we roll the die for a large number of times, we see that the result indeed approaches the expected value 1/6 (= 0.166666) or 16.667%.
